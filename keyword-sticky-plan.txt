#GOAL: create a chrome app that combines the functionality of pearls and of a sticky note apps. I want something that
gives me a sticky note i can look at any time a certain keyword pops up (and ideally the ability to minimize
or close those sticky notes

SUBGOAL:find a way to allow a user to generbate sticky notes and store them in the variable sticky_note_vals
SUBGOAL2": Allow the user to put a tag under those sticky notes and store it in the variable keyword_tag
SUBGOAL 3:plug keyword_tag into a function that takes a list of keywords and highlights every occurance of them
        on the webpage
SUBGOAL2:grab the coordinates of each highlight and store it in the variable . keyword_loc
SUBGOAL3: get a function sticky_placer(): that can be used to decide the position of a sticky notes, plug keyword_loc
into it.
SUBGOAL4:save the configuration of the sticky notes somehow, mainly size and color , within a dictionary
that uses keywords as keys and size,color,and content as values. (size,color,and content should be variabilized into
a blanket finished_sticky_note variable) That variable will be a value that is attached to each key
SUBGOAL5: when the domain appears again, iterate through the list of keywords. For each keyword, take the associated
sticky_note_vals. Plug the keywords and the sticky_note_val into sticky_placer and wait for the notes to pop up.
